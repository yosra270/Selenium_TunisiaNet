## Why Selenium ?

New software releases are being *delivered faster and more regularly than ever*. It’s become crucial for companies with any level of digital footprint to *improve the efficiency and accuracy of their testing* to keep up with their competitors. Therefore, companies are adopting ***Agile*** and ***DevOps*** as the new models for modern software engineering.

Accelerated product release requires *accelerated coding*, which needs *accelerated testing*. Every time an application (or updates to the application) hits the market, it needs to be *perfectly functional* for each user. The only way to ensure flawless functioning is to *test each feature and update comprehensively*. To do so manually in restricted timelines for complex, feature-rich software is impossible. Automation is the only recourse.
**Without automation testing, the speed required to actually make development “agile” cannot be brought into the picture.**

Automation testing in Agile allows ***Continuous Testing*** for QAs in a DevOps environment ensuring therefore that new code is bug-free before it hits the production environment. Furthermore, automation allows running ***cross-browser and cross-platform tests.***

Automation testing in Agile is implemented via several tools and frameworks such as **Selenium**.

Selenium is an open-source and a portable automated software testing **set of tools** including **Selenium IDE, Selenium RC, Selenium WebDriver and Selenium Grid.**

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ---------- |
| Selenium IDE | a plugin that allows testers to record their actions as they follow the workflow that they need to test. |
| Selenium RC | was the flagship testing framework that allowed a QA or a developer to write test cases in any programming language in order to automate UI tests for web applications against any HTTP website. |
| Selenium WebDriver | the successor to Selenium RC which sends commands directly to the browser and retrieves results. |
| Selenium Grid | a tool used to run parallel tests across different machines and different browsers simultaneously which results in minimized execution time. |

In this project, we will be using **Selenium WebDriver** as a test automation tool.
